# Plotter
This is a small application to visualise mathematical functions.
As I never planned to upload this project, some variables and comments are still in german, but I'm working on change them into englisch.

You can download the compiled file here: http://cmayer.bplaced.net/Plotter/publish.htm

Until yet, the auto-detection for multiplication is not fully implemented.
If the programm doesn't set the star by itself, you have to do it or the result will be wrong.
